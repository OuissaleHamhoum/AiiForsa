# ATS Analysis Report — Overall Score: 35/100

## Summary
- Score: **35/100** — Needs improvement.
- Core sections are incomplete or missing (experience, projects, skills), and formatting is not fully ATS-friendly. Filling those gaps will raise parsing confidence and keyword matches.

## Key Findings & Actionable Suggestions

- **Profile**
  - Errors: Missing professional title, location, and secondary contact.
  - Action: Add a concise title (e.g., "Full-Stack Developer"), location (city, country or `Remote`), and at least one verifiable link (LinkedIn/GitHub/phone).

- **Summary / Headline**
  - Warning: Summary is lengthy and lacks domain keywords.
  - Action: Shorten to 2–4 lines and include primary keywords (e.g., `MERN Stack`, `Flask`, `REST APIs`).

- **Work Experience**
  - Errors: Missing job titles and bullet descriptions; dates inconsistent.
  - Action: For each role add: title, company, `MM YYYY – MM YYYY` (or `Expected`), and 2–4 XYZ bullets including tools and metrics.

- **Projects**
  - Errors: No projects.
  - Action: Add 1–2 projects with a short description, technologies, GitHub links, and measurable outcomes.

- **Skills**
  - Errors: Too generic and ungrouped.
  - Action: Group into `Technical` and `Soft` skills, list proficiency (e.g., `Python — Advanced`), and prioritize relevant tech (DBs, frameworks, CI/CD).

- **Education**
  - Errors: Degree type and graduation date missing.
  - Action: Add degree, institution, and expected/completed graduation date.

- **Certifications**
  - Errors: None listed.
  - Action: Add relevant certifications or completed courses (AWS, Coursera, etc.).

- **Languages**
  - Errors: Only Arabic listed; proficiency unclear.
  - Action: Add English/French if applicable and use CEFR levels (e.g., `English — B2`).

- **Grammar & Style**
  - Errors: Minor punctuation and hyphenation issues.
  - Action: Standardize capitalization and hyphenation (e.g., `22-year-old`) and maintain consistent date/title formatting.

- **XYZ Pattern (Achievements)**
  - Errors: No measurable achievements.
  - Action: Convert responsibilities into XYZ bullets: e.g., "Built X using Y leading to Z% improvement".

## Prioritized Quick Wins (fastest score lift)
1. Add title + location + LinkedIn/GitHub.
2. Fill one recent job with a title and 3 XYZ bullets (include tools and metrics).
3. Add one project with GitHub link and measurable result.
4. Group technical skills and add proficiency for top 8 items.
